    	<h2>Lighting in the urban age</h2>
		<p>
        More than half the world’s population currently lives in cities and it is estimated that this figure will rise to 66% by 2050 (World Urbanisation
Prospects, 2014). Yet it sometimes seems that we only use our cities and towns
half as much as we could; once shops and offices close, levels of activity drop.
		</p>
        <p>
		While the urban renaissance of the last 20 years has delivered greater levels of city-centre living, all too often, this fails to translate into the successful ‘24 hour’ city. Lighting, if considered in the right way, can positively impact our night time environment; it can reinforce urban design principles, enhance cultural experiences and encourage social interaction.
		</p>
        <p>
		How can lighting designers play a more active role in shaping the sort of socially sustainable places we would like to see? How can lighting designers, urban planners and architects develop a collaborative approach in order to create welcoming and inclusive places that work 24 hours a day, and not just for half of the time?

    <h2>The International Year of Light</h2>
    	<p>
		Light plays a vital role in our daily lives and is an imperative cross-cutting discipline of science in the 21st century. It has revolutionised medicine, opened up international communication via the Internet, and continues to be central to linking cultural, economic and political aspects of the global society.
        </p>
		<p>
        On 20 December 2013, The United Nations (UN) General Assembly 68th Session proclaimed 2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies (IYL 2015).
In proclaiming an International Year focusing on the topic of light science and its applications, the United
Nations has recognised the importance of raising global awareness about how light-based technologies
promote sustainable development and provide solutions to global challenges in energy, education, agriculture
and health.
Shaping a sustainable future – particularly through the urban environment – is one of the greatest challenges
in the 21st century. Strategic lighting design can have an impact on the ‘Total Architecture’ of the city, both
today and in the years to come. Thinking of lighting in its functional and cultural roles in urban plans can
create places that work better for people and that are sustainable for the environment and for businesses.

    <h2>Sensorial City</h2>
		<p>
The 24 hour city is an amalgamation of constantly changing conditions.
We see the city in the daytime, and the same city in the nighttime, yet we often
take for granted how implicit light is to crafting and shaping our experience.
</p>

<p>
This experience pod uses abstract impressions of light to create a series of four separate and distinct urban
scenes – a playground, a high street, a residential street, and a café/bar. Each scene has a distinct feel of a
space over the period of a day. We see the space in day and night, in light and shadow, in colour and
monochrome. These subtle variations demonstrate how light affects our perception and feeling towards our
surrounding; and in turn its role in socially designing urban places by day and by night.
</p>

<p>
Sound cues help contextualise the narrative cast in light by providing both locational clues and supporting
ambiance. To place the audience in a park during the daytime, sound cues may transmit noises of children
playing. But transition to a later time and the park may be silent with the distant rustle of trees blowing.
Sound is utilised to augment our sensory experience of the space around us.
</p>

<p>
Sensorial City provides you with an innate understanding as to how light can shape, reshape, create and
obfuscate our collective notions of space. This experience pod acts as a stand-in for the city around us.

	<h2>Who's smart?</h2>
    	<p>
The rise of smartphones, GPS and wearable technology has had a
dramatic impact on the way in which we communicate and behave.
</p>

<p>
With the majority of people living in cities now connected, there is a growing desire to network
more of the physical objects that we use every day – the ‘Internet of Things’. This creates new
interaction opportunities and captures even more data streams. Big data companies see this as an
expanding market, where ‘smart’ devices are the gateways to a new world of insights on
people’s behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Lighting technology has undergone a similar disruptive change since the introduction of LEDs.
The aspiration for more energy efficient lighting is creating pressure to make LEDs ubiquitous
inside buildings and around cities.
</p>

<p>
Smart lighting lies at the convergence between the Internet of Things and LED technology. By
connecting light using the languages of the web, we can create an ‘Internet of Light’. And since
light is everywhere, we can use it as an infrastructure to unlock hyper-local services inside and
outside buildings.

		<h2>What does light mean to you?</h2>

<p>
Light is fundamental to all social life, yet public realm lighting can often
focus on prescriptive design standards, rather than designing with social
relevance for the way that humans interact in a modern 24 hour city.
</p>

<p>
Are there ways in which lighting design, urban planning and sociology can increase opportunities for
citizens to feel welcomed and participate in the public realm after work hours? And likewise, how can
we ensure that night workers feel safe as they move through the streets in the hours of darkness?
</p>

<p>
Through a series of candid interviews with members of the general public in different cities around the
world, the very subjective and personal reflection – ‘What does light mean to you?’ – is deliberated
and captured in order to stimulate our thinking on a matter which affects us all.
</p>

<p>
Purposefully provoking, it aims to elicit emotional and individual responses, so that we can consider
the type of lighting that delights, enhances and helps foster a better sense of safety.

	<div data-role="content">	
		<h2>Daylight</h2>

<p>
Daylight is vital to our health and well-being and is the only truly
sustainable light source. Making more use of daylight in place of electric
lighting can help reduce energy consumption. These are just two reasons
why prioritising daylighting in cities is important for developers,
architects, politicians and society as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Given its importance to all our lives and well-being, ensuring our homes and places of work have
access to adequate daylight is a mainstream issue. Daylight must be enshrined in the regulations that
shape our cities and considered in the earliest design phases of any building development. It is crucial
to embrace daylighting design at the beginning of a holistic 24 hour lighting design process, where
buildings are designed for daylight first and supplemented with electric lighting later. This approach
can achieve significant reductions in energy consumption from lighting and increases in the quality of
interior spaces.
</p>

<p>
A unique light source, daylight is variable by day, by season and by location, driven by the movement
and position of our planet around the sun. Understanding this relationship allows us to create design
solutions specific to the project context and climate, generating geometrical forms that are informed
by the movement of the sun. This allows architecture and the built environment to be informed and
shaped by daylight.

		<h2>A tale of urban lighting</h2>

<p>
Memory is an uninterrupted tale; a subjective construction of
interpretations of place, a sequence of emotions and sensations;
a sense of familiarity.
</p>

<p>
The emotional visual journey through the city defines the polyphonic composition of our
memory through experiences, and light is an integral element that contributes to the
harmony of this composition. Light narrates spaces imbuing them with a language made
of colours, darkness, flickering intensities and glittering surfaces.
</p>

<p>
Words are made of light; the language of light transforms bricks, opportunities, surfaces,
smiles, chairs and trees in luminous prose. People are the narrative centres in this prose –
a tale made with light.

	<div data-role="content">	
		<h2>Media architecture</h2>

<p>
In recent years, rapidly developing technology in lighting, media
and building materials has led to the creation of a new type of
hybrid architecture – lighting and media appear as a layer that can
be woven into a three dimensional space – simply known as media
architecture. In a wide sense, media architecture is any surface in the
three dimensional built environment that contains a matrix of lights
that are individually controllable.
</p>

<p>
This approach is fundamentally different to traditional architectural lighting and offers endless
new opportunities in designing the built environment. This ethereal lighting layer has great
impact on the human experience of space.
</p>

<p>
The possibilities with regard to pushing the boundaries in media architecture are huge and as
society moves towards ‘carpe noctem’ (seize the night), architecture and design need to adapt
and offer attractive solutions to this transformation.
